# Paper-Spray

Forked from [Kumar](https://github.com/kumarkrishna) and
[Biswa](https://github.com/biswajitsc)'s [Paper Spray](https://github.com/kumarkrishna/paper-spray) this repository is a collection of papers I have read or would want to read encompassing Tech, Human Rights, Law and Policy.

__We have created a webpage for [Paper-Spray](https://hargup.in/paper-spray.html) containing a searchable list of the papers in the json file.__

Entry format:
> * <a href="link">Paper Title</a>  
> ```Date Added, Keywords```  
> ```Author, Conference, Year```

<!---
CLI for adding papers :
* Add ```$paperspraypath``` as environment variable for path to the github repository.
```sh
export paperspraypath=/path/to/github/repository
```
* Add an alias to .bashrc / .bash_profile to directly add papers from any folder through terminal :D .
```sh
alias spray-papers="bash $paperspraypath/scripts/add_papers.sh"
```
 * Use ```spray-papers``` as terminal command.
